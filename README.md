### Final Project

The final project pertains an exploratory data analysis on a database called "gapminder". This is a database where data on population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy in each country and region are collected. The EDA final project includes an analysis on (1) GDP per capita across region, (2) the relationship between population and life expectancy, and (3) cluster analysis using divisive hierarchical clustering.
